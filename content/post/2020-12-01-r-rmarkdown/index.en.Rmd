My name is Maellin Dineros and I am an undergraduate student at CSU Channel Islands on track to receiving my Bachelor's Degree on May 2023. I am majoring in Mathematics with an emphasis in Statistics and minoring in Computer Science. After graduation, I will start my professional career as a Data Scientist intern in Mission Produce. With my foot already at the door, it is my goal maintain this path to one day become a Data Scientist working towards improving wildlife and nature.

## Why Mathematics and Computer Science?

The fundamentals of Biology is Chemistry, the fundamentals of Chemistry is Physics, and the fundamentals of Physics is Mathematics. Mathematics itself is life, and Computer Science makes Mathematics more fun and efficient.

## My Academic History:

-   I will be graduating with a Mathematics major and a Computer Science minor in May 2023.

## Fun Facts About Me:

-   I love puzzles. I do not mind being called "boring" when I would rather play Beat-Your-Own-Score puzzle games over multiplayer games.
-   I can finish any mystery/romance book in a day. My current favorite romance book is "Love & Words" by Christina Lauren and mystery book is "The Killing Game" by Iris Johansen.
-   I have two gray kittens and two Maltese Poodles! My cats are named Sky and Mittens (he looks like he's wearing socks!) and my dogs are named Mikmik and Potchi (after Filipino sweet snacks).
-   My most favorite purchase of the year is a wet vacuum by BISSELL. It is both a solids vacuum and a mop and saves me time from doing two passes of my entire house!
