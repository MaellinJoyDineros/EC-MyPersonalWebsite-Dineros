<h2>Fun Facts About Me:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I love puzzles. I do not mind being called “boring” when I would rather play Beat-Your-Own-Score puzzle games over multiplayer games.</li>

<li>My most favorite purchase of the year is a wet vacuum by BISSELL. It is both a solids vacuum and a mop and saves me time from doing two passes of my entire house!</li>
